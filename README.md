The datasets are too large to place on the GitHub, but all the EEG data used can be accessed from the following link: https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/bg257f92t
To my memory we had to download the files one by one since the system was not very convenient.

The main codes used are "Attention_Model.ipynb" and "LSTM_Model.ipynb"
