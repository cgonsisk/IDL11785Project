The datasets are too large to place on the GitHub, but all the EEG data used can be accessed from the following link: https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/bg257f92t
To my memory we had to download the files one by one since the system was not very convenient.

The main codes used are "Attention_Model.ipynb" and "LSTM_Model.ipynb". Both were run on Colab Free using Google Drive to access the files. It may not run directly due to not having access to the data.

LSTM_Model.ipynb is the EEG2Phoneme approach that is similar to the HW3P2 problem. The architecture is generally similar to what was used for that assignment. For more details please see the report.
Attention_Model.ipynb is the EEG2Word approach similar to the HW4P2 problem using attention. 

For both models the the code is in python notebook format and a reviewer may follow along with the code to see the data loading, preprocessing, and model creation/training.
